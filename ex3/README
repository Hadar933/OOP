==============================
= Locker & Long term storage =
==============================
in both the locker and the long term storage implementations, the data is
stored inside a Map data structure.
given a key of some item's type(such as basketball or a helmet),the map retrieves
a value that represents the number of items of such type exist in the locker or
in the long term storage.
the usage of map for that purpose makes the handling of the locker and the lst fast and
convenient, and enables us to use methods such as get, set and delete
in average of O(1) time.

=====================================
= data sets for Booping site tests  =
=====================================
given three different data sets (empty, small and big), Iv'e checked that each
method from the BoopingSite API outputs the corrent value, as specified in the
exercise description. both edge cases that consists illegal inputs and cases of
legal inputs were checked, while the tests made sure that the results were alligned
with each data set expected result values.

=============================
=     compare by rating     =
=============================
The method works as follows:
given some city, the function builds an array consisting of all relevant
hotels in the city, and sorts (from highest rating to lowest) the valus according
to a designated compare function.
the compare function compares the stars rating, and if they are equal, compares by name.

=============================
=   compare by proximity    =
=============================
both of the methods getHotelsByProximity and getHotelsInCityByProximity are
based on the following:
given some coordinates, sort all hotels (or all hotels in some given city)
in order of the distance from the given coordinates. if the distance of some two
hotels from the coordinates is even, sort by their POI ratio.
