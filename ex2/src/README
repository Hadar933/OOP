==============================
= Extensibility & Modularity =
==============================

Each ship i've implemented is an extention to the SpaceShip general instance.
the SpaceShip class represents a general form of ship, with methods that can be
over written. the most important method is doAction - the doAction Implementation
in SpaceShip class is a general method that performs actions that are similar to
all ships,but each specific class that inherits SpaceShip can override doAction-
thus enabling further expantion to the method, adding dedicated features.

This makes adding a new ship with different features to our game a rather simple
task: construct a new class representing some exotic space ship, inherit SpaceShip
and override doAction as you please. This, in turn, enable us to represent our
specific ship with some general ship traits such as energy, health, cool-down
time, etc, combined with dedicated Implementations.

=====================================
= Intuitiveness & Understandability =
=====================================

I would say that the Modularity of the implementation has made the code rather
intuitive and easy to understand. one major factor to this is, as i've mentioned
before, is that the code can be easily expanded (add more ships, change ship
traits and so on.). Furthermore, the Inheritance tree is small, contaitining one
"node" (SpaceShip class) and 6 "leafs" (each ship class), which I believe corresponds
with simplicity

=============================
= Representation of Classes =
=============================

It is worth while mentioning that each ship class should be obliviate to its
neighbors. for example, an instance of Human ship, should not rely on a basher
ship, and vice verca. I think that this implementation has made clear that each
Class illustrates this idea

=================================
= Drunkard & Special ships Idea =
=================================
Drunkard: the ship will moves in the other direction from the closest ship to it,
          and will shoot randomly in all directions.

Special: the special ship has a defense mode in which when ever some ship is too
         close (some constant threshold), it automatically recognises it and
        shoots towards the ship (specifically, the special ship will adjust its
        angle towards the enemy ship and shoot). other then that, the ship will
        more freely, based on random values.
