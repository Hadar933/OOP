Extensibility and Modularity:
the class SpaceShip is the base, mother-class for all ships. it has the basic functions every ship has.
since the ships of types Aggressive, Basher, and the special ship have the common feature of chasing enemy
ships, I created another class, Chaser, which implements the chasing method. Aggressive, Basher, and the
special ship all inherit this feature from it.
now if we want to add features to the aggressive-behaving classes, we can work only with the class Chaser
which all of them inherit from.

Intuitiveness and Understandability:
we have similar-behaving ships inherit from the same classes. the names of the classes are very descriptive
and make the use of them very intuitive.

Drunkard behavior: this ship has a drunk pilot who decides to turn based on current energy level (turns every
round), shoots whenever possible and teleport whenever possible.

Special behavior: this ship body-guards a human player and shoots only at non-human ships. if it is close to
the human ship it stays near it and acts as a human shield, literally.
